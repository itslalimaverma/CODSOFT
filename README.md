    <h1>Calculator with Python and Tkinter</h1>
    <p>This is a simple calculator application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to perform
        basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Addition: Perform addition of two or more numbers.</li>
    <li>Subtraction: Perform subtraction of two numbers.</li>
    <li>Multiplication: Perform multiplication of two or more numbers.</li>
    <li>Division: Perform division of two numbers.</li>
    <li>Clear: Clear the current input and reset the calculator.</li>
    <li>Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and displays appropriate error messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>The calculator is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. When a button is clicked,
    the corresponding function is called to handle the input and perform the calculation. The input is displayed in
    a text entry widget, and the result is updated accordingly.</p>

<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
<p>This calculator is a basic implementation, and there are many ways to improve and extend its functionality. Some
    possible future enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Support for more advanced operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).</li>
    <li>Implement keyboard support for input.</li>
    <li>Add a history feature to store previous calculations.</li>
    <li>Improve the UI design and layout.</li>
</ul>


  <h1>Tkinter Python Weather App</h1>
  <p>This is a simple weather app built with Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit, that allows users to check the weather conditions for a specific location.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Search weather for any city or location.</li>
    <li>Display current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).</li>
    <li>Responsive and user-friendly GUI design.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.</p>
  <pre><code>pip install tkinter
pip install requests
git clone https://github.com/your_username/weather_app.git
cd weather_app
python weather_app.py</code></pre>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>1. Run the "weather_app.py" file.</p>
  <p>2. Enter the name of the city or location for which you want to check the weather.</p>
  <p>3. Click the "search" button to retrieve the current weather conditions for the specified location.</p>
